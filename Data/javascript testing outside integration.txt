to test a javascript map function outside integration, you can use a local or online testing utility to run your script. declare variables for the function inputs and outputs and assign values and inspect the console output accordingly. be sure to remove any excess debugging code and remove the variable assignments to correspond with the function's inputs and/or outputs before copying the script back into platform. one example of an online editor is w3schools' tryit editor.
