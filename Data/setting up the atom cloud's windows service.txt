by setting up the molecule's clouds windows service, you can continuously run processes in the background without manual user intervention on the platform. before you beginbefore completing these steps, install the initial cloud molecule. procedure after installing the atom cloud's first cloud molecule, go to control panel > administrative tools > services. right-click the cloud service and select properties. click the log on tab. by default the service logs on as the local system account. change the service to log on as an account with access to the shared directory. optional: if you are a service user and not a local administrator of the machine, then you need to grant the user permission to start and stop the service. see the following articles on windows service security: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/914392http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc742133%28ws.10%29.aspxhttp://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc742037%28ws.10%29.aspx get the security identifier (sid) of the windows user to whom you want to grant access; typically this is in the form of: s-1-5-21-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx get the service dacl of the cloud service on a particular machine. run the following command, replacing "cloud service name" with the name of the service installed on your machine: sc sdshow "cloud service name" the result is a long service dacl string: (the following is an example only.) d:(a;;cclcswrpwpdtlocrrc;;;sy)(a;;ccdclcswrpwpdtlocrsdrcwdwo;;;ba)(a;;cclcswlocrrc;;;iu)(a;;cclcswlocrrcwp;;;su)(a;;cr;;;au)(a;;cclcswrpwpdtlocrrc;;;pu)s:(au;fa;ccdclcswrpwpdtlocrsdrcwdwo;;;wd) add the following string to the dacl using the sid. insert this before the s: at the end of the dacl: (a;;cclcrpwprc;;; s-1-5-21-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx) this change grants stop and starting capabilities to this specific user on this specific machine. the new dacl will look like this.
