boomi resolve shows possible solutions to document or process errors.when you view details about a document or process error in the manage menuâ€™s process reporting page, the boomi resolve tab in the error details lists possible solutions to the error. these solutions are retrieved from the boomi resolve database. this database relates unique integration error messages to articles in the boomi community knowledge base and this documentation. a single article may be related to multiple error messages and a single error message may be related to multiple articles. the boomi resolve tab lists possible solutions in descending order of relevancy based on assigned relevancy scores and includes links to the full articles.the boomi resolve database grows over time as processes run, errors occur, and more error messages are associated with articles.the database currently is exclusively populated by boomi, however users can contribute resolutions similar to field mappings to the boomi suggest database.note: users that opt out of the data collection feature (settings > account information and setup > features) do not have access to boomi resolve.
