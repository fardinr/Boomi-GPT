in this scenario, an inbound document is routed according to the trading partner. for example, a company has two trading partners, a and b. if trading partner a sends a document, it is automatically routed to a specified map or connector according to the settings in the route shape. if trading partner b sends a document, it is automatically routed to a specified map or connector according to the settings in the route shape. if trading partner c sends a document, the file is routed down the default path and can go to a stop shape or an exception shape with an error message.
