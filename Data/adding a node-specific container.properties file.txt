to set a molecule’s or atom cloud’s container properties differently on a per-node basis, create a separate container.properties file for the node and set its properties. about this taskthe values in the node’s container.properties file override any values in the molecule or atom cloud’s container.properties file that are relevant to that node. properties that are set in the integration user interface always modify the molecule or atom cloud’s container.properties file and never the node’s container.properties file. procedure use a text editor to create a container.properties file. name the file to include the node’s localhostid, as follows: container.<localhostid>.properties add to the container.<localhostid>.properties file only the properties that you want to override. set the override values for the properties. save the container.<localhostid>.properties file in the molecule or atom cloud’s <installation_directory>\conf directory. optional: repeat steps 1–4 for each node that needs a separate file. restart the nodes that have new container.properties files. nodes that have a separate container.properties file use the properties that have been modified in their file. nodes that do not have a separate file continue to use the properties in the molecule or atom cloud’s container.properties file.
