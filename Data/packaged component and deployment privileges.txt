user roles and privileges determine what a user can see and do in the deployment workflow. building components, creating packaged components, and deploying all require different user privileges. privilege enables the user to... build read and write access design, build, and modify processes and components. packaged component management create and manage deployable packaged components. this privilige was formerly known as package management. packaged component deployment deploy packaged components to test and production environments. this privilege was formerly known as process deployment. the platform standard user role and the platform administrator role include all of these privileges. so users who are assigned one of those roles can build, create packaged components, and deploy by default. however, as a best practice, boomi recommends that you establish a separation of duties, especially as it relates to different environments. for example: developers might be allowed to build, create packaged components, and deploy to a development environment, but they should not be allowed to deploy to the production environment. you might want to divide tasks among different users in a given environment, having one user who builds and creates packaged components, and another who deploys. to separate these tasks, you can create custom roles (such as a build and packaged components role, or a packaged components and deploy role) and assign to them only the privileges that are needed. then those roles can be assigned to one or more environments, as appropriate. note: if you have custom roles that include any of the following privileges, you should consider adding the packaged component management privilege to those roles: build read and write access integration pack packaged component deployment process library
