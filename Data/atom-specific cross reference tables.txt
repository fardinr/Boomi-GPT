an atom-specific cross reference table enables you to specify values that are generated based on the atom that is running the process. if an atom does not need a specific configuration, you can use the default value in the atom column. note: boomi discourages developers from enabling atom-specific values in a cross reference table. cross reference table extensions are now the preferred method for extending or replacing a set of values in a table.
