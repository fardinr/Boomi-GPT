depending on the lead type, this sample javascript or groovy custom scripting function sets values for a variety of fields accordingly. if the mapped values are static, this type of mapping requirement can often be met using a cross reference table. this logic could also be implemented as a series of if/else statements. inputs leadtype (character) outputs salesrep priority script switch (leadtype) { case"direct": salesrep = "kevin"; priority = "high"; break; case"referral": salesrep = "louisa"; priority = "low"; break; case"reseller": salesrep = "sarah"; priority = "medium"; break; case"oem": salesrep = "sarah"; priority = "low"; break; default: salesrep = "adam"; priority = "medium"; }
