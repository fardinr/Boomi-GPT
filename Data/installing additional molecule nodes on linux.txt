after installing the initial molecule node on your linux operating system, install additional molecule nodes to give your application more processing power. before you beginbefore completing these steps, install the initial molecule node. about this task you must run these steps on each machine that you are adding to the molecule. procedure on the machine on which you want to run the node, mount the nfs directory containing the initial molecule installation (<molecule_installation_directory>) where <molecule_installation_directory> is the name of the directory. start the node manually by running this command: <molecule_installation_directory>/bin/atom start optional: for a sysv-style initialization where the node starts automatically at linux startup, do the following: create a link in the /etc/init.d scripts directory to the <molecule_installation_directory>/bin/atom script. configure the system to start this script by using existing sysv setup tools. note: the specifics of this step might vary depending on your linux distribution. after starting the new node, verify that it joined the molecule by looking in the <molecule_installation_directory/logs/<date>.container.<machine_ip_address>.log file for a message like this: info: started <machine_ip_address> as cloudletaddress <machine_ip_address>:7800, initial cluster view: cloudletaddress <other_machine_ip_address:7800, cloudletaddress <machine_ip_address>:7800, ...
