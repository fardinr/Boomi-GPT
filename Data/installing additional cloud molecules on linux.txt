after installing the initial cloud molecule on your linux operating system, install additional cloud molecule nodes to give your application more processing power. before you beginbefore completing these steps, install the initial cloud molecule. about this taskyou must run these steps on each machine you add to the atom cloud. procedure on the machine on which you want to run the cloud molecule, mount the nfs directory containing the initial cloud molecule installation (<cloud_installation_directory>). start the cloud molecule manually by running this command: <cloud_installation_directory>/bin/atom start optional: for a sysv-style initialization where the cloud molecule starts automatically at linux startup, do the following: create a link in the /etc/init.d scripts directory to the <cloud_installation_directory>/bin/atom script. configure the system to start this script by using existing sysv setup tools. note: the specifics of this step might vary depending on your linux distribution. after starting the new cloud molecule, verify that it joined the atom cloud by looking in the <cloud_installation_directory/logs/<date>.container.<machine_ip_address>.log file for a message like this: info: started <machine_ip_address> as cloudletaddress <machine_ip_address>:7800, initial cluster view: cloudletaddress <other_machine_ip_address:7800, cloudletaddress <machine_ip_address>:7800, ...
