if your server has multiple versions of java installed, you can force an atom, molecule, or atom cloud to change versions. about this taskwhen installing an atom, molecule, or atom cloud, java 8 or 11 is required. boomi recommends java 11. note: boomi internally tested amazon corretto openjdk java 1.8.0_362 and amazon corretto open jdk 11.0.18.10.1. it is recommended that you use the most recent version of java that boomi supports. procedure make a copy of the inst_jre.cfg file that is located in the <installation_directory>\.install4j directory. name the new file pref_jre.cfg. delete the contents of the new pref_jre.cfg file and add the location of the jre or jdk that the atom, molecule, or atom cloud should use. using a java 8 jre on a windows machine looks like this: c:\program files\java\jre8 or c:\program files\jdk1.8.0\jre. save the file. (for atom clouds and molecules that are running with multi_process, which enables forked execution) to specify the appropriate system properties in the atom.vmoptions file, do the following : go to manage > atom management. select the atom, molecule node, or cloud molecule from the list. in settings & configuration, click properties, and then click the advanced tab. select the java class path prepend property (-classpath/p), click add a property, and enter the location of the jre or jdk. select the java library path property (-djava.library.path), click add a property, and enter the location of the jre or jdk. click save. because changes to this property do not take effect until the atom, molecule, or atom cloud is restarted, you are prompted to restart. you have the option to restart now or restart later. after the atom, molecule, or atom cloud is restarted, it should now use the version of java that is in c:\program files\java\jre8 or c:\program files\jdk1.8.0\jre (if you changed it to use java 8), depending on whether you want to use a jre or a jdk.
