you can model file-based data structures that contain different types of records within the same file by using a single flat file profile with multiple record formats. identify the individual records by either a unique "identity value" within each record or by the number of columns. record formats within a profile typically use the same format detection method: identify value or number of columns. data sets with multiple record formats typically do not have column headers but configure the profile to match your actual data. multiple formats can be used to model simple edi-like structures. consider using an edi profile for more complex data sets. to import the elements for a data set with multiple record formats, use the import wizard for each record format individually. modify your sample file to isolate the record format you want to import.
