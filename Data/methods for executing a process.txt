there are several ways that you can cause a process to execute. set a schedule — this is the most common method use to execute a process. schedules can be set in as little as one-minute intervals to kick off the start shape. a process retrieves zero documents if a schedule is enabled on a start shape using a web server connector because the process is set to listen for documents in real-time. process call shape in a parent process — the child process executes for each document that is forwarded to the process call shape if the connector or no data option is selected. review the passthrough option to learn how this option affects the processing. a parent and child process fails if a process call in the parent is set to call a child enabled with web server listening. process route shape in a parent process — the child process executes based on a reference that is set at run time. execute process api — any of the start shape options can be used for this method, with the exception of trading partners or connectors that require web server listening. web server listening — the methods above does not work if a connector option or trading partner option is defined with one of the following connectors. as2 server connector - legacy web services server connector
