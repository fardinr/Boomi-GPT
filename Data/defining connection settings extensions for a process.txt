select properties that vary between deployments. about this task connection settings extensions are the most common extension type. procedure open the process and click the extensions link above the process canvas. the extensions dialog opens. on the connection settings tab, select a connection component from the connection list. this is a list of all the unique connection components referenced in this process or any child processes. select the check box next to each property to extend. you need to select only the properties that vary between deployments. for example, if you know you need to connect to "test" and "production" instances of a database server, you would probably extend host, user, and password as those would vary between instances, but other properties like database type and db name is likely the same across both instances. in this case, you should define the database type and db name in the database connection component and not extend those properties. repeat steps 2-3 for each connection. when you are finished defining extensions, click ok. click save. if you add a new connection component to your process, revisit the extensions and define any extensible properties for that connection. next stepsafter defining connection settings extensions, you need to set values for them. see the topic setting extension values linked below.
