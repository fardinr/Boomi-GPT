in this scenario, a document is routed according to a specified element in a flat file profile. if the inbound document does not meet the requirement set in the route shape then the document can be routed to a exception shape with an error message. for example, the route shape checks for inbound 944 and 945 documents. a 940 document comes in. the 940 document will be directed to the exception shape with the following error message: "the document does not meet the requirements set in the route step. please review the inbound data." this can help you to troubleshoot an issue because the error is captured in the exception shape with a very specific error message.
