processes are the central components in integration. they contain the series of shapes that determine how data is executed within the system. a process typically represents a discrete workflow that moves a given type of record from one application to another. see the component overview topic to learn about the different ways to create a process. after you create a process, it opens in a full-screen view on the process canvas. the links at the top of the process canvas access these functions: options — edit process options. extensions — define extensions for the process. (available only if extensions are enabled.) add note — drag and drop sticky annotations on the process canvas. show navigation — display or hide the navigation palette, which you can open if the process is too large to view in its entirety. create packaged component— close the component or process on the build page and navigate to it in the list on the package managed component page (deploy menu > packaged components). this feature is available only on accounts with the packaged component management privilege. arrange — automatically align and organize shapes, branches, and routes on the process canvas. test — execute the process in test mode.
