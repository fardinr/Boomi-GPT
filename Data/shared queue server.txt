atom message queuing makes use of the atom's shared queue server. the default configuration of the server is likely to be suitable for your purposes, at least initially. you can configure the shared queue server if you are the atomâ€™s owner by using the shared queue server panel. note: port 61717 is the default port for communications between instances of the shared queue server in a molecule or atom cloud cluster. you need to make sure the systems in the cluster have this port open for incoming tcp traffic. you can select a different port in the shared queue server panel.
