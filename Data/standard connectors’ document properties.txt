for some standard connectors you can set properties that are used during processing, such as disk file name, ftp remote directory, or mail subject. these properties are displayed on the process reporting page at the document level. note: not all connectors have properties that can be retrieved or set. when setting a standard connector property, you are setting it for the outbound connector to which the document is to be sent. a typical use is specifying the file name before writing to a disk or ftp directory. do this with a set properties shape to set the appropriate standard connector property. for example, to send to a disk connector, set the disk file name; to send to an ftp connector, set the ftp file name. to send the same document to both connectors, set both properties. see the set properties shape for more information. when retrieving a standard connector property, the value is always taken from the original inbound connector used in the start shape. for example, a process retrieves a file from an ftp server. using a set properties shape to set the ftp file name to a value and then referencing the ftp file name property in a subsequent shape, the returned value comes from the original ftp connection in the start shape, not the value specified in the set properties shape.
