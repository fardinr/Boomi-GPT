use java visualvm, or a similar java monitoring tool, to perform a rolling restart. before you beginif you have not configured java visualvm, see the topic about configuring java visualvm for jmx management. about this taskwhen you apply maintenance to a molecule or atom cloud, you can use a java monitoring tool for jmx management, such as java visualvm which is included with the java jdk, to perform a rolling restart of all nodes in the molecule or atom cloud. with a rolling restart, running processes finish before the node they are running on is restarted. procedure start java visual vm. in the application list, double-click the entry for the molecule or atom cloud that you want to restart. a new tab named for the molecule or atom cloud opens in the right pane. on the new tab, click the mbeans tab. in the tree on the mbeans tab, expand com.boomi.container.services and click the containercontroller mbean. click the operations tab, and then click rollingrestartcluster. the following occurs: each node waits for currently running processes to complete before restarting. the cluster rolling restart percentage property (com.boomi.container.cluster.rollingrestart.clusterrestartpercentage) controls what percentage of the nodes are restarted simultaneously. the default is 20%. the rolling restart force timeout property (com.boomi.container.cluster.rollingrestart.forcerestarttimeout) controls how long a node waits for restart to complete. after this amount of time, the node begins restarting regardless of the status of any other nodes. the default is 30 minutes. the rolling restart next in line timeout property (com.boomi.container.cluster.rollingrestart.nextinlinerestarttimeout) controls how long a node waits for the "next in line" node to complete the restart process and return to running status. the default is 5 minutes. you can use the atom management page (manage > atom management) to monitor the status of the molecule or atom cloud.
