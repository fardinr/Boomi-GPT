you can change the default node name, which is based on the ip address of the machine on which the node is running. about this taskwhen setting a custom node name, you can simplify the management of nodes in a cluster by setting the name to something other than the ip address. if you are running multiple nodes on the same machine, you must set a unique node name for each node in the molecule or atom cloud explicitly.caution: running multiple nodes on the same machine is not recommended for a production installation, and it will not work with forked execution enabled.boomi supports an environment variable that enables you to define a unique, persistent name for each node in a cluster. note: for nodes that were installed by using docker, you do not need to set the environment variable. the docker installation script sets the environment variable automatically based on the node name string rather than the docker container ip address. procedure in a system initialization script or from the command line, use the atom_localhostid environment variable to specify a node name. for example, on linux you specify the following: export atom_localhostid="node_name" use the <atom_installation_directory>/bin/atom script to start the node, or restart the node if it is currently running.
