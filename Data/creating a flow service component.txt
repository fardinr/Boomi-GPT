create a flow service component to serve as a means by which a flow service interacts with integration processes.procedureon the build page, click new.the create component dialog opens.in the type list, select flow service.enter a name for the component, select a folder to store it in, and click create.when you create the component, it is stored in a flow services sub-folder. the flow service component opens.in the general tab in the metadata section, type the external name that is exposed to flow. click copy to clipboard adjacent to path to service.in flow, paste path to service into the url field for the service and insert the host name of the atom to which you will deploy the component — for example, https://c01-usa-east-integrate.boomi.compath_to_service.return to the flow service component in integration.optional: add a configuration value(s) as a means of including account-specific information from requesting flows. each configuration value sent from a flow with a service request becomes a dynamic process property in the flow services server listener process that provides back-end processing for the requested action. these dynamic process properties are named inflowconfigurationvalues_<configuration_value_name> — for example, inflowconfigurationvalues_vendorid.for each configuration value you want to add:click add configuration value.in the add configuration value dialog, type a name.select the type.optional: to make the configuration value a required value in flows from which service requests originate, turn on require that this value be specified in the flow that points to this component.click add.optional: add a message action. optional: add a file resource. optional: add a data action object type. click save to save the component. next stepssee the deploy page topic for information about deploying flow service components and processes. see the flow help for information about configuring flow services.
