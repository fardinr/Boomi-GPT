fibers are the string of shapes in the process flow that follow a flow control shape with parallel processing options defined. for example, setting number of threads to 2 spawns two fiber executions. when a process execution reaches a flow control shape with number of threads or processes set to a number greater than 1, the current (controlling) process execution essentially pauses. the current collection of documents are divided according to the desired number of threads and a "fiber" execution is started for each thread. the flow control shape then waits for each of the fiber executions to complete and handles the results. the controlling process never executes the shapes that follow the flow control shape in the process because they were all executed by the fiber executions. fiber executions are very similar to "inline" process executions (see process call), except that the "child" processes start mid-process â€” at the flow control shape from which the fiber execution was launched.
