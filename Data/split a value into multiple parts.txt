this sample javascript or groovy custom scripting function splits a single address street "block" into individual lines (up to five) based on a line break. this can also be accomplished with the standard string split function. inputs street (character) outputs line1 line2 line3 line4 line5 script lines = street.split("\n"); line1 = lines[0]; if (lines.length > 1) { line2 = lines[1]; } if (lines.length > 2) { line3 = lines[2]; } if (lines.length > 3) { line4 = lines[3]; } if (lines.length > 4) { line5 = lines[4]; }
