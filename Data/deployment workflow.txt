the workflow for deploying a process or component to an environment involves building the component, creating a packaged component, and then deploying the packaged component. the basic steps to successfully deploying a process or component are as follows: a developer builds a process or deployable component on the build page. a developer or administrator creates a version of the component by creating a "packaged component" from the build page or the packaged component page. an administrator deploys the packaged component to one or more environments from the packaged component page or the deployments page. after a packaged component is deployed, you can use the deployments page to manage your active deployments. the following illustration shows the basic steps for building and deploying.
