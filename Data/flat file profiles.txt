flat file profiles represent structured data sets that contain rows of data, typically with one record per row and each row containing a series of fields known as elements. the most common example of a flat file data set is a basic comma-separated-value (csv) file. the structure of the elements in a flat file data set is defined as one of two types: delimited — each element is separated by some specific character (the delimiter), such as a comma, asterisk, or pipe. elements can be variable in length. data positioned — each element begins at a specific column position and has a specific length. in general, configure the flat file options to match the basic structure of your data set and then use the import wizard to import a sample file and quickly create the individual elements for each record format. note: flat file profiles were updated in may 2016 to support additional parsing functions for delimited flat file data. when you open a profile that was created prior to may 2016, you are prompted to upgrade the profile to the new format. support continues for both formats; the appropriate parser is used for a given profile.
