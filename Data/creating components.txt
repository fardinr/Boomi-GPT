you can create components on the build page or by copying them from published processes you install from the process library. on the build page, to create a component, use the create new button, component explorer, the start tab, or the process canvas. when you install a published process from the process library, the process component and all of the components used in the process are copied into your account. the process library is accessible from the build page. here are some tips for creating components: use a consistent naming convention for components. organize! think about folder hierarchy, common components, connections, etc. before digging in. avoid saving components in the root folder. use sub-folders to manage integration projects. you can easily move a component to a different folder by dragging and dropping it. give meaningful, self-describing names to components. for example, name a process "salesforce won opportunities to netsuite sales orders" rather than "my salesforce process". delete or rename components that are no longer used to avoid confusion later.
