this example uses the salesforce operation, however the configuration and filter support for other connectors may be different. see the individual connector documentation in the application connectors section for more information. about this taskyou can create multiple filters and add multiple parameters and mix static and dynamic values. one common dynamic value used in the start shape is a filter that extracts records where the "last modified date" is greater than a value, then pass in the special last run date value as the parameter. this is how you can design incremental synchronizations. procedure create or edit an operation component. click the options tab. optional: click the import button and use the wizard to generate the xml profile and configure the operation. at the bottom of the page, add a filter. configure the filter with a user-defined name, the field to filter against and a comparison operator. the user-defined name is displayed as the operation's inputs. note: this filter name displays in the list of operation inputs when the operation is referenced. save the operation. create a new process and edit the start shape. the start shape dialog opens. on the general tab, select the appropriate connector type, an existing connection and the operation from above. click the parameters tab. click add to add a new parameter. this parameter will represent the value to pass into one of the filters defined in the operation. click browse next to input and select a filter to provide a value for and click ok. notice this value is the same as the user-defined filter name above. set type to static. specify a value to pass into the operation input and then click ok. save the operation component.
