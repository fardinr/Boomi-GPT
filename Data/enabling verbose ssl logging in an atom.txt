to enable debugging for troubleshooting issues with secure contexts, set the enable ssl debug logging property on the properties panel. before you begin you must have the atom management privilege to perform this task. if you have the atom management read access privilege, you cannot perform the task. about this task the effect of setting this atom property is equivalent to the effect of setting the property javax.net.debug=all in <atom_installation_directory>/bin/atom.vmoptions.note: enable this debug option only if you are working with boomi support and they recommend it for troubleshooting tricky ssl problems such as ssl handshakes, ssl/tls packet transmissions, etc. disable verbose ssl logging immediately after completing troubleshooting. leaving verbose ssl logging on during general operations can adversely affect the atomâ€™s performance. procedure go to manage > atom management. select the atom, molecule, or cloud molecule from the list. in settings & configuration, click properties. the atom properties panel opens. click the advanced tab. select the enable ssl debug logging property (com.boomi.container.debug.ssl), click add a property, and select its property value check box. click save. because changes to this property do not take effect until the atom, molecule, or cloud is restarted, you are prompted to restart. you have the option to restart now or restart later. next stepsrefer to this oracle article for more information about debugging ssl/tls connections.
