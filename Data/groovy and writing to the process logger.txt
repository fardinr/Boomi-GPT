with groovy, you can output debugging information to the process log at various points throughout the script to help with development and troubleshooting. //import the executionutil class import com.boomi.execution.executionutil; //retrieve a handle to the logger logger = executionutil.getbaselogger(); //log your message. you can also use the info(), warning(), severe() and fine() methods to create entries with different log levels. logger.info("got to this point in the script! importantvariable=" + importantvariable); //there are fine/debug entries in the process log for test mode executions and failed process executions. there are no fine/debug entries in the process log for processes that executed successfully. note: you cannot access the process logger if you use javascript in a map function.
