the deploy page provides access to all deployment-related activities in accounts where you enabled environments. it includes packaging, deploying processes and components, and installing integration packs shared with an account. note: to help you make the transition to the new packaged component deployment workflow at your own pace, boomi is releasing this functionality as an optional account feature. if you want to enable this feature in your account, contact your account administrator. account administrators can upgrade their legacy deployment accounts by selecting packaged component deployment from the settings > account information and setup > features page. when you click deploy you can select one of the following, depending on your account and user privileges: packaged components — lets you create and manage deployable packages for the processes and components that you build. deployments — lets you monitor existing deployments and create new deployments. integration packs — let managed account users deploy or install shared integration packs.
