atoms, molecules, and atom clouds use your system’s scripting engine to complete some tasks. the following scripting engines are supported: shell (.sh), batch (.bat) and powershell (.ps1). the scripting engine that is used depends on whether you are running windows or linux. if you are running: linux, shell scripts (.sh) are used in all situations. windows and you are running an atom, batch scripts (.bat) are used. windows and you are running a molecule that does not use unc paths or forked execution, batch scripts (.bat) are used. windows and you are running a molecule that uses unc paths or forked execution, powershell scripts (.ps1) are used. windows and you are running an atom cloud, powershell scripts (.ps1) are used. the atom, molecule, or atom cloud uses your system’s scripting engine to do the following tasks: restart — using the restart.sh, restart.bat, or restart.ps1 script file launch forked executions in molecules and atom clouds — using the procrunner.sh or procrunner.ps1 script file launch atom workers in private atom clouds — using the procworker.sh or procworker.ps1 script file launch the browsing of connector operations that run in forked executions in molecules and atom clouds — using the procbrowser.sh or procbrowser.ps1 script file note: the procrunner.bat, procworker.bat, and procbrowser.bat script files are included in installations, but they are no longer used.
