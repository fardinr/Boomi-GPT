create an empty directory on your windows network drive and share using windows file sharing. before you beginbefore completing these steps for a windows boomi installation, download the local molecule installer.note: you must set up a shared directory when installing and using molecules. procedure choose or create a user that runs the molecule. this user shares the directory and runs the molecule as a service on various windows machines. create an empty directory on the windows server. the molecule installer uses uniform naming convention (unc) paths to access a shared directory. therefore, create this directory on a file server that can share it with the other machines used for the molecule. share the directory by using windows file sharing. do not use a mapped network drive path (such as d:\) because you cannot use drive mappings for windowss services. instead, use a unc path (such as \\somepath) to the network drive. ensure the user has full control privileges on the share and the entire atom installation folder path. note: grant privileges to the user explicitly rather than adding the user to an administration group. next stepsnext you need to install the first molecule node.
