after installing the initial molecule node on your windows operating system, install additional molecule nodes to give your application more processing power. before you beginbefore completing these steps, set up the moleculeâ€™s windows service.warning: if there are unicode characters in the directory path to where you intend to install the molecule nodes, the installation will fail. about this task you must run these steps on each machine you add to the molecule: procedure open powershell. on the machine on which you want to run the node, navigate to the bin directory of the full unc path of the molecule, such as cd //<host_name>/share/<molecule_installation_directory>/bin where <host_name> is the name of the machine. temporarily set the execution policy for powershell to be unrestricted for this session. in powershell, run the following command: set-executionpolicy unrestricted. run the node-install.ps1 file using the command: ./node-install.ps1 open control panel > administrative tools > services. right-click the molecule service and select properties. click the log on tab. change the service to log on as the user that you created for the molecule. optional: if the user is a service user and not a local administrator of the machine, then you change the service dacl as described in the instructions for installing the initial molecule node. start the service. after starting the new node, verify that it joined the molecule by looking in the log at <molecule_installation_directory/logs/<date>.container.<machine_ip_address>.log file for a message, such as: info: started <machine_ip_address> as cloudletaddress <machine_ip_address>:7800, initial cluster view: cloudletaddress <other_machine_ip_address:7800, cloudletaddress <machine_ip_address>:7800, ...
